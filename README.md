## <div align="center"><samp>Observability Approach</samp></div>

<div align="center">
  <samp>
    I instrument services with structured logging, metrics, and traces to make production behavior debuggable and measurable. My preferred stack combines OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing, Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, Loki for log aggregation, Sentry for real-time error tracking, and Elasticsearch/Kibana for deep log search and incident forensics. This ensures reliable microservice operations, faster root-cause analysis, and proactive alerting before user-impacting failures.
